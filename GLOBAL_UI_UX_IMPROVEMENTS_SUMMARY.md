- **Responsive Sizing**: Improved modal sizing across all device sizes
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Enhanced header gradients and spacing

### 8. Global Layout Improvements

#### Container and Spacing Consistency (`layout.css`)
- **Unified Padding System**: Consistent padding across all components
- **Responsive Containers**: Improved container sizing and spacing
